about:
  home: https://github.com/sergiocalde94/pydrift
  summary: How do we measure the degradation of a machine learning process? Why does the performance of our predictive models decrease? Maybe it is that a data source has changed (one or more variables) or maybe what changes is the relationship of these variables with the target we want to predict. `pydrift` tries to facilitate this task to the data scientist, performing this kind of checks and somehow measuring that degradation.
