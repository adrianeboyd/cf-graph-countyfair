about:
  home: https://pypi.org/project/warrant-lite/
  summary: Small Python library for process SRP requests for AWS Cognito. This library was initially included in the [Warrant](https://www.github.com/capless/warrant) library. We decided to separate it because not all projects and workfows need all of the helper classes and functions in Warrant.
