   "description":"The International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) project is a model-data\nintercomparison and integration project designed to improve the performance\nof land models and, in parallel, improve the design of new measurement\ncampaigns to reduce uncertainties associated with key land surface processes.\nBuilding upon past model evaluation studies, the goals of ILAMB are to:\n\n* develop internationally accepted benchmarks for land model performance,\n  promote the use of these benchmarks by the international community for\n  model intercomparison,\n\n* strengthen linkages between experimental, remote sensing, and climate\n  modeling communities in the design of new model tests and new measurement\n  programs, and\n\n* support the design and development of a new, open source, benchmarking\n  software system for use by the international community.\n\nIt is the last of these goals to which this repository is concerned. We have\ndeveloped a python-based generic benchmarking system, initially focused on\nassessing land model performance.\n",
