   "description":"The River Avulsion and Floodplain Evolution Model (RAFEM) is\na cellular model that simulates river and floodplain morphodynamics\nover large space and timescales. Cell size is larger than the channel\nbelt width, and natural levees, which maintain a bankfull elevation\nabove the channel bed, exist within a river cell. The river course is\ndetermined using a steepest-descent methodology, and erosion and deposition\nalong the river profile are modeled as a linear diffusive process. An\navulsion occurs when the riverbed becomes super-elevated relative to\nthe surrounding floodplain, but only if the new steepest-descent path\nto sea level is shorter than the prior river course. If the new path to\nsea level is not shorter, then a crevasse splay is deposited in the\nadjacent river cells. The model has been designed to couple with the\nCoastline Evolution Model through the CSDMS Basic Model Interface.\n",
